FanMap
======

This is a Hackathon project for the FC Bayern HackDays. The FanMap helps
connect fans across the world by letting them upload geolocation-tagged selfies
for display on an interactive and entertaining world map.

You're going to need a fairly recent version of Python_ 3, python-sfml_, and
requests_. Then, run ``make`` and ``python selfiemap.py``.
